        <p>
            For a summer project, I have done an internship with WaterApp Technologies Private Limited, an IoT-based company. 
            I will give a general overview of the project and features here.

        <h2 class="subheading">The Architecture</h2>
        <img src="architecture_diagram.png" alt="Architecture Diagram">
        <p>
            Each WaterApp location consists of sensors, RTUs, and gateways. Sensors talk to RTUs (short-range wireless communication device) 
            which further relay information to gateways (long-range wireless communication device). Gateways then upload sensor data to the cloud, 
            which you can view on the app.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subheading">The Problem</h2>
        <img src="over-under.png" alt="Over Under Image">
        <p>
            Due to improper placement of gateways and RTUs in a site, a gateway might be talking to very few RTUs in a location which is inefficient 
            or a gateway might be talking to too many RTUs in a location, leading it to get overloaded. Rarely, RTUs might talk to gateways from different 
            locations entirely, which is sub-optimal as that means the RTU can't reach the gateway that is present in its current location.
            These issues were hard to solve as there was no easy way to see how the RTUs and gateways were communicating with each other.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subheading">The Solution</h2>
        <p>
            After brainstorming a bit, I figured that a neat way to solve this issue will be to create a graph/ chart that shows all the gateways 
            and RTUs in a site and the communications taking place between them. This way, we get a clear visual understanding of all the elements 
            in the site and if there are any problems in them.
